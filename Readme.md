# Software Developer Challenge

## Challenge 1: 
Read through the rest of the assignment, decide which technologies to use and explain why you chose what you chose. 
Create a small network or component diagram.

We expect the following languages to be considered

* Golang
* React
* PostgreSQL
* Mongodb
* Redis


Front end task are not mandatory, it can be replaced with a strong typed API and the unit test, and scripts to make it work.



## Challenge 2: 
Create a deployable “Hello World” Server exposing simple REST “Hello World” API. It is going to be a base for your application for this assignment.

## Challenge 3:

Pick one of the available online API’s such as 
* Twitter (https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api), 
* LCBO (https://lcboapi.com/) 
* Weather (https://openweathermap.org/api), 

create and implement a flow involving that API and user of your application. For example, your application might have following UI:

![Sample UI](./sample-ui.png?raw=true "Sample UI")


User will insert text and click the button `Search` and your application will search tweets that contain submitted string. Note: it is only an example, go wilder than that :)

** If FE is not being develop, please create a robust API that can be tested using Postman or CURL, provide the steps and use cases for such API Methods.


## Challenge 4:

Make your application secure and personalized by making people to have to sign-up / login. 

Bonus points, if 
* users will be able to reset their passwords.
* you implement a SSL/TLS server

## Challenge 5:

Make your application persistent. Whatever functionality your application has, after restart, make it possible to view a history of user activity or anything else you deem necessary.

## Challenge 6:
Test your application.
Provide Unitest and testing scripts or steps to reproduce use cases.

Make use of logs, use logging in your application, either to a file or to syslog.

## Challenge 7:

Let us know how we can use it. You could either provide us with a zipped file containing your solution or a link to your Github repository containing one.


## Reminder:

Coding standards, best practices and repository rules will be consider, and get extra points.
